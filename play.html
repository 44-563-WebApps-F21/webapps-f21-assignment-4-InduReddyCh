        <h4>The Importance of Being Earnest</h4>
        <h5>ACT I. Algernon Moncrieff’s Flat in Half-Moon Street, W. - Morning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is
            luxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard
            in the adjoining room.</h5>
        
            <p>ALGERNON.<br>
Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?</p>

<p>LANE.<br>
I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.</p>

<p>ALGERNON.<br>
I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.</p>

<p>LANE.<br>
Yes, sir.</p>

<p>ALGERNON.<br>
And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?</p>

<p>LANE.<br>
Yes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]</p>

<p>ALGERNON.<br>
[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the
way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
champagne are entered as having been consumed.</p>

<p>LANE.<br>
Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.</p>

<p>ALGERNON.<br>
Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.</p>
