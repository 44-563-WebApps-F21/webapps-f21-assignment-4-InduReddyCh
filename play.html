    <span>SCENE.--</span>_ <span class= "a">Morning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is
        luxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard
        in the adjoining room.
        
        [Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has
        ceased, Algernon enters.]</span>

       
<p class= "name1">ALGERNON.<br>
<span class= "char"> you hear what I was playing, Lane?</span></p>

<p class= "name2">LANE.<br>
<span class= "char">I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.</span></p>

<p class= "name1">ALGERNON.<br>
<span class= "char">I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.</span></p>

<p class= "name2">LANE.<br>
<span class= "char">Yes, sir.</span></p>

<p class= "name1"> ALGERNON.<br>
<span class= "char">And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?</span></p>

<p class= "name2">LANE.<br>
<span class= "char">Yes, sir. <p= id ="direction">[Hands them on a salver.]</span></p></p>

<p class= "name1" > ALGERNON.<br>
<span id ="direction">[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]</span><br>
<span class= "char">Oh! . . . by the
way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
champagne are entered as having been consumed.</span></p>

<p class= "name2" >LANE.<br>
<span class= "char">Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.</span></p>

<p class= "name1" >ALGERNON.<br>
<span class= "char">Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.</span></p>
